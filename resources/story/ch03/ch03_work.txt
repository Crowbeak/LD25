You're about to type RUN when the door to the stairwell bangs open. A
troop of policeman run in, guns at the ready, yelling and looking
ready to shoot any and all of the employees at the slightest
provocation.

And they come straight to your desk.

"You're under arrest for criminal negligence tantamount to treason,"
states the woman with a gun pointed directly at your face. She says a
lot of other things, too, but so quickly you you don't quite
understand.

As they drag you away, the last thing you see is Dave gaping at you 
rom his cubicle entrance.
