It's been over three months and Dave is still a mess. At least he's
able to work, now. For a bit there it looked like he was going to lose
the job, too, which he definitely didn't need. You've been doing
everything in your power to try to help him through this, but there's
only so much you can do. Staying up late to console him or keep him
company has really been a drain of late.

But your ferret still loves you!

Even if he does keep ferreting your house keys away.

After making sure Dave gets back to his desk on time, you sit down at
your own. You really don't want to be here today, but your choices are
limited.

Limited to three.
