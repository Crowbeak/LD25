Time passes. Universes are born and die.

Okay, so that much time hasn't actually passed. But the days do wear
on. Romance still isn't going that great, but you got a ferret to keep
you company. Didn't think too much about the smell before making that
purchase, but... too late now, and you like the little guy. He's a lot
more interesting than a cat. And you never wake up with his butt in
your face like Wedge complains about with his cat.

You're already to your desk and pushing the power button on your
computer when you realize Dave wasn't in the kitchen this morning.

Weird. Wanna look into that?
