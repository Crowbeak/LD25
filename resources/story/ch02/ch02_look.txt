It doesn't take you long to find him. He's sitting at his desk. Dave's
not his usual, bubbly self, though. He's staring so hard at his
screen, leaning forward on his elbows, that he doesn't even hear you
say good morning.

Something is most definitely wrong. Dave saps that greeting up like a
tree does sunshine.

Needless to say, he's startled when you tap his shoulder. He turns to
look at you and there are tears in his eyes. He turns back to the
computer to wipe his face off. You look away akwardly as you inquire
if something suddenly happened with his wife. (It would have had to be
VERY suddenly, because they were DEFINITELY on good terms when you all
went to see the newest Kumoman movie last night.)

"She's leaving me."

You can't get a coherent account of what happened out of him, but with
a bit of work you convince him to go rest at your place. He doesn't
want you to go with him. After making him promise to call you if he
needs anything, you go to your desk and get to work. It's not like you
have anything better to do. Work will be a nice distraction.
