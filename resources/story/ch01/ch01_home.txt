You barely catch Dave before he rockets downstairs to let him know
that you'll be ducking out on the crew for lunch. After asking him to
give your regards to Biggs and Wedge, you grab your jacket and head
home.

It's nice to live within walking distance of work, isn't it? Even with
the quality of mass transportation here, there's something about
walking that feels nicer. Especially after long hours in a chair
staring at robot output simulations.

The house is quiet when you get home. It always is. Maybe you could
get a cat? You flip on the TV before rummagaing through the fridge.

Ah, crap... no sandwich meat. Grilled cheese it is, then.

The news is showing on TV at the moment. You can't make out all of
what's being said over the sizzling skillet, but apparently it's all
about terrorists. But then, it always is, these days. The same old
headlines are starting to get kind of old.

You plop down on your couch and eat your delicious, delicious grilled
goodness. Unfortunately, you forget to change the channel BEFORE you
grab your greasy sandwich. You manage to finish the sandwich and clean
the remote with just enough time to get back to work on time.

And there was much rejoicing. Yaaaaaay.
