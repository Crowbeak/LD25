You mosey your way down to the first floor. Dave has beaten you there
and is sitting with Biggs and Wedge at a table smack dab in the middle
of the room. You grab a tray of food and 'wedge' yourself in between
the two 'bigg' guys.

You quickly regret your punny decision when Wedge slaps you on the
back. At least he's gentler than usual. Maybe you'll just have a
bruise this time.

"Hey, man! =D" he says. He's got one of those silly emoticon things
embedded in his forehead to make sure you see the smiley face. Real
friendly guy, but he doesn't always make the best decisions. Biggs,
his brother, just smiles and waves. He has all the brains his brother
missed out on, but he's a good guy, too. Quieter, though, and
stronger. Wouldn't want to be against him in a fight.

You guys shoot the sheep around the table for about 20 minutes before
Dave's wife calls and completely diverts his attention. Wedge uses
that as an excuse to "go to the bathroom", by which he means hit on
one of the new employees a few tables away.

You and Biggs idly watch the news on a nearby monitor. More terrorist
activity. Has it been on the rise, lately? Ah, who cares. After a
while, the sensationalist headlines all blur together.

Wedge comes back before Dave -- no surprise there -- and you guys go
back to talking about... uh... what were you talking about? Must not
have been important.
