Dave laughs at you and calls out, "See you later!" You wave at a couple of
other people on your way to your desk, and plop down into your cushy chair as
soon as you get there. You don't realize until you've already turned your
computer on that you were so annoyed with Dave you didn't get any coffee.

Damnation.
