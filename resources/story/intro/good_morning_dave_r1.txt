Dave laughs at you and calls out, "See you later!" You wave at a
couple of other people on your way to your desk, and plop down into
your cushy chair as soon as you get there. You don't realize until
you've already turned your computer on that you were so annoyed with
Dave you didn't get any coffee.

Damnation.
