your orientation. You are the newest 'robot' on farm #512. This," he'
continues, attaching something to your wrist, "is your ID bracelet. It
contains all your data -- your ID number and your stats. The stats
are: your 'age', or years in labor service; the amount you can carry
in tens of pounds; your 'battery life', or how many hours of work we
can get out of you in a day; your utility rating, which is assigned by
sargeants like myself; how much it costs us to feed you; and the
number of times you've gotten sick or injured -- 'broken down'."

"Your performance is closely monitored and evaluated on a regular
basis, especially when new 'robots' become operational."

He grins, and this time it looks downright nasty. "Oh yeah... you
already know that part."

"Now, this is where I normally tell new 'bots that if they work long
and hard enough, they might get to join proper society. But I think
you know that society class folk like your-former-self believe the
farms and factories are worked by actual robots. So I won't insult you
with that pep talk."

"Any questions?"
