A sharp jolt rouses you. You're in a vehicle of some kind, travelling
down the absolute bumpiest road you've ever encountered in your life.
As you raise your head, a policeman sitting across from you turns and
yells towards the front of the vehicle.

"He's awake, sarge."

"Damn," comes a muffled voice, "I was looking forward to waking him
myself."

Your mouth feels funny. When you try to lift your hands to feel it,
you discover that your hands are chained to the floor. There are
straps holding you up against the wall of the vehicle, and you
couldn't reach the buckles to make an escape attempt if you tried.
