The discomfort of your mouth and your grogginess are making it hard to
process much, but you're slowly becoming more aware of your
surroundings. While you're opening and closing your mouth to test it
out -- your jaw seems to be working fine, but your tongue is just not
with the program -- a second policeman sits next to the first opposite
you.

"Hmm," he says. "Don't see eyes that color often out here. He'll be
good breeding stock."

"I dunno, sir," replied the first man. "He seems kinda scrawny to me."

"Yeah, but genetic diversity is important, too."

Are they... are they seriously discussing you as if you were
livestock?

Apparently the 'sarge' notices your reaction. The smile he gives in
response is NOT a friendly one.
