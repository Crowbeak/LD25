The vehicle makes a turn and slows to a stop.

The policemen bundle you out of the car and shove you to your knees in
the mud before undoing your wrists. When your eyes adjust to the light
and catch up to your nose, you can see that the horrible smell is
animal dung' strewn about the yard.

The sargeant points to a solitary goat in one corner.

"That goat is your charge until you're told otherwise."

He then points to a girl nearby.

"She'll teach you everything you need to know." He grins another one
of his horrible grins. "You'd best learn quickly. Your utility stat
depends on it."

The girl comes over to help you up, smiling, as the policemen drive
away.

If none of this had happened to you, would her fate have been in your
hands tomorrow?
