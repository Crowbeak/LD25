By the time you're taken before a judge, you've been in police custody
for... a while. You're not sure how long. The way they've been
treating you, it just feels like... too long.

Much to your dismay, you're not taken to a courtroom. You get to sit
down, but it's across a table from a judge in what looks like an
informal meeting room.

"Have you anything to say in your defense?" he asks simply.
