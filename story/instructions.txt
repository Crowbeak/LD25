SUMMARY:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your job is to maximize the output of our nation's farms and factories by
assigning labor robots to each appropriately. This usually coincides with
assigning new robots to farm or factory positions and decommissioning old
robots for parts.

You will run one or more simulations for a given set of farms and factories and
use the results to decide which robots to decommission. You may run as few or
as many simulations as you deem necessary.

TIPS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When new robots are constructed, room must be made for them by decommissioning
an equal number of robots.

Robots with higher utility stats tend to be more useful in factories.

Robots with higher carrying capacity tend to be more useful on farms.

REMEMBER:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your job is essential to the prosperity of our nation. Output from the farms
and factories translates directly into available goods such as food and
clothing. You must keep in mind, however, that as metal becomes
increasingly rare, salvaging older robots for scrap is important, too. There
are some things advanced plastics still can't handle, and for that we need
metal.

As a Decommissioner, you are responsible for maintaining a good balance between
goods produced and metal recycled.

Do your duty, for yourself and for us all.
