This is my first ever Ludum Dare entry ever.

It was made in spite of a 12-hour handicap brought on by time differences.
It was made in spite of a sorely lacking skillset.
It has no graphics or sound; in fact it is a Python IDLE text game.

The theme for this Ludum Dare is You Are the Villain. The gameplay does not
obviously reflect the theme in and of itself, but if you play through to the
end, you can see how I incorporated it.

I also added the fun +1 goat.

Viva Ludum Dare!
