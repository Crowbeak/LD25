The first version of this game was made for Ludum Dare 25.
Current version is hereby dubbed 0.2.

Ludum Dare is what's called a "game jam". A game jam is an event in which game
developers have fun honing their skills by conceptualizing, designing, and
programming a game in a short period of time and usually with some other
limitations.

This particular game jam has two variants which run concurrently. One requires
that entrants work alone and do everything within 48 hours; the other allows
for teams or otherwise bending the rules and lasts 72 hours. Both run off the
same theme, which is voted upon by participants during the course of the week
leading up to the jam.

The theme for this Ludum Dare, Ludum Dare 25, was You Are the Villain. The
gameplay does not obviously reflect the theme in and of itself, but if you
play through to the end, you can see how I incorporated it.

The original version of Decommissioner was made for the 48 hour compo in spite
of: a 12-hour handicap imposed by time differences; a sorely lacking skillset;
and my having no generic code written up beforehand. It had no graphics or
sound. In fact, it ran as a text game in the Python IDLE console, though I was
able to compile versions that didn't require the user to have Python installed.

I have preserved the original by maintaining it as its own branch on GitHub.
This is the start of the soon-to-be improved version. Planned changes,
organized into prioritized tiers, are:

HIGH
- make it so simulation results can be saved for reference/reloaded before
  choosing what to decommission
  - side bonus: make saved results available to affect story
- Use file I/O to separate story from function code.
MEDIUM
- more branching storylines
- multiple endings
- move job description out of how to play and into main story trunk
- balance robot simulation to make breakdowns more realistic
    - number of breakdowns per robot
    - stats of old robots relative to existing assignments
    - general balance
- Implement robot repurposing
- make robot id number generation less obviously fake
LOW
- add background music
- add graphics
    - though I might keep the robot sim looking like DOS

Viva Ludum Dare!
